# The Assignment

I was given the assignment to consider self-reported recommendation data for a product. The broad topic was to understand recommendation dynamics.

The data consisted of five variables:
*  ``buyer_purchase_ts``: Timestamp of the buyer's ("recommendee's") purchase
*  ``buyer_id``: Unique ID for each "buyer"
*  ``recommender_id``: Unique ID for each recommender
*  ``buyer_trial_starts_ts``: Timestamp for a buyers trial start
*  ``recommender_trial_start_ts``: Timestamp for a recommenders trial start, if available

I was also told that the standard pathway to a purchase is through a trial.

## Questions

The assignment asked me to consider two questions:
1. Explore the data and present the three, in my opinion, most interesting findings
2. Present the three hypotheses I would like to explore next and explain why

I could present my solution in any way I deemed appropriate.

## My Solution

My solution consisted of a presentation available [here](presentation.pdf) and a supplementary Jupyter notebook available [here](notebook.ipynb).

## Remark

While the company was so generous to grant me permission to share this work, they asked that I remove any mentioning of the company's name. Thus, the name is either replaced with *Company X* or I speak of *the product* or *the company*.
